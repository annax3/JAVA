Object Collaboration, Method ,polymorphism

=> In Object Oriented Programming Language Like Java, multiple Classes Collaborate with each other and Provide
    Services(Solution to the particular Problem).
    * Inside one class We can create object of other class the condition is The Classes Which will try to collaborate
     each Other,  should be in same path.

     Ex:  class A
          {
                  //i and funA are two non static member
                 int i=10;
                 void funA(){
                      sout("Inside funA");
                      }
          }

          //other file Demo.java
          class Demo{
                  public static void main(String[] args)
                  {
                  sout("Inside main methid of Demo");

                  Demo d1=new Demo();
                  A a1 = new A();//Object of A class (Different class)

                  sout(d1);
                  sout(a1);

                  }
           }

    * We can define a class as a instance member of another class as well, by this we establish "Has-A" relationship
      between 2 objects.
