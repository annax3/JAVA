Note : an abstract class does not have any meaning, until it is not extended by the child class. An abstract class mean
to be extended.

Ex : Animal : cat,Dog,Lion
     i can tell you that you can show me a Animal But you can show me a Dog ,Cat, Lion
     i say no no i want to see a Animal I don't want to see Cat DOg and Lion i want to see Animal
     He say it is not possible because Animal is abstract(It doesn't have own existence) Because Its existence depend
     upon its child classes.

With the abstract class and abstract method we achieve abstraction in JAVA
